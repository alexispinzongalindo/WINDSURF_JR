# Design Reference Notes (From User Screenshots)

Use these notes as the visual direction for future islaAPP UI updates.

## 1) Marketing Header
- Keep the top navigation clean and not overwhelming.
- Prefer 5 primary options in header.
- Put deeper links inside the page content, not all in top nav.

## 2) Hero Direction
- Large centered headline.
- Prompt-first input area where user types what they want.
- Fast suggestion chips under the prompt.
- Primary CTA should be obvious and singular.

## 3) Template Catalog
- Visual thumbnails are required (not only template names).
- Cards should look like mini app previews.
- Users should be able to open template details.
- Include actions like `View app` and `Use/Clone template`.

## 4) Template Detail View
- Dedicated detail area with:
  - large preview
  - title + short description
  - feature/highlight list
  - action buttons

## 5) Pricing Style
- Stage-based plans that are easy to compare.
- Clear card layout with credits/limits and highlights.
- Minimal friction for deciding a plan.

## 6) Header + Mega Menus
- Keep only 5 primary header items visible.
- Use dropdown mega-menu panels for deeper navigation details.
- Menu cards should include short title + one-line explainer.

## 7) Use Cases Blocks
- Use bold split layouts with visual mockups on one side and message on the other.
- Prefer rounded cards with gradient backgrounds and clean typography.

## 8) Enterprise Hero
- Use a dedicated enterprise band with soft gradient and direct `Talk to sales` CTA.
